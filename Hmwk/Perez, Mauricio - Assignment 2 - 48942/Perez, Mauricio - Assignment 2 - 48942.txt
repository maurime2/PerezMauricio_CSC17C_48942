Found in Github link on the homepage.

1)  Add a push routine that will augment the array by 1 and double at the top to hold the new value pushed.

2)  Add a pull routine that takes one value off the top of the array and decreases the size by 1.

3)  Create a Github account using your first 2 intials and student id.  Configure a repository exactly as I have done.  Place your work inside this repository.  Make mlehrjava a collaborator of your repository.
